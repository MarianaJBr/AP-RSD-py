 # AP_RSD_py
AP part of the RSD analysis in configuration space for eBOSS LRG sample.

DISCLAIMER: 
* This code has not been maintained since it was originally developed in 2017. * 

Data is public now and it can be downloaded from: https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr16/eboss/lss/catalogs/ 

The analysis should be done together with Gaussian Streaming Model for RSD and the Convolution Lagrangian Perturbation Theory. More info in CLPT_GSRSD https://github.com/wll745881210/CLPT_GSRSD 

The development of this code has profited from the very valuable input of a number of people. They are acknowledged here:

Run CLASS with the cosmology:
 
LCDM with Omega_m=0.307115, h=0.6777,  sigma_8=0.8288, Omega_b=0.048206,  n_s=0.9611 which in turn means 
H0=67.6, ombh2=0.022, omch2=0.251857*0.676^2 and get the P(k) at z=1.7
